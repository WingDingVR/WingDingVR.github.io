## 1. What does this cover?

This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) establishes how we collect, use, protect, store, disclose, and process your Personal Information (defined below). This does NOT apply to information you provide to any third party or that is collected by any third party (except as otherwise provided below).

## 2. How do we process Children’s Personal Information?

In accordance with the policies of Meta®, our Games are available to Quest Pro, Quest 2, Quest 3, and next-gen headset users at least 10 years of age who access our Games using a Parent-Managed Account.

If you become aware that an underage user has provided us with Personal Information or that a user has accessed our Games without using a Parent-Managed Account as required by Meta, please contact us by emailing [founders@wingdingvr.com](mailto:founders@wingdingvr.com) so we may delete their Personal Information.

If you self-identify or are identified by Meta® as being between 10-12 years old, your gameplay experience will use OculusID and cannot be changed. Additionally, sounds of the avatar (bird chirping or dragon roars) will be used by default.

Children identified as being 10-12 years old will have access to spaces for their age group, whereas players 13 and older will not. Players wrongly accessing these spaces could face suspensions or bans.
